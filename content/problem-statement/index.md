## Introduction

With advancements in data collection technology, there are a lot of opportunities for good and for bad. There could be good in the form of improved technologies made to help people. However, this technology could be used to gather sensitive information on people and hurt them with it in the form of data leaks, predatory genealogy practices, and identity theft. We are faced with a difficult question: in what ways can we help to ensure that new technologies are being used in their good capacities and not being used in their bad capacities?

## Motivation

- Wearable healthcare devices can collect large amounts of data that has the potential to provide valuable insights
- Advancements in AI tech can improve usage of wearables data for health
- Current technologies do not take good advantage of wearables data, sometimes due to privacy and ethical concerns 
- The goal is to recommend innovative ways to build healthcare devices with AI systems, with ethical considerations in mind. 


## Problem for the Semester

There are missed opportunities for wearable devices that can provide constant monitoring of patients.
- Data collected by personal wearable devices are not always in an accessible or useful format to aid diagnosis for medical professionals and doctors. 
- With the increase of health data collection ensuring that laws, regulation, and ethics protect the privacy of individuals while still utilizing the data collected effectively is important. 


## State of the Art

In this section, we provide an overview of the state of the art organized into three categories:
1.**Sensors and data collection**, covering the wearable devices and other mechanisms that allow individuals to collect personal data about their health.
2. **Ethics, privacy, and risks,** addressing the ethical issues that arise from the collection of personal health data, the privacy provisions that must be addressed, and the risks that systems that contain personal health data must take into account.
3.**Data management systems**, describing how data is transmitted, organized, stored, managed, analyzed, and delivered to users, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders.

We address each of these topics in the next subsections.

## Design and Approach

Part I: Analysis of 3 aspects of the state of the art:
**Sensors and Data Collection**
Surveying existing smart technologies and their capabilities
Measurement and collection of data
Evaluating the potential to facilitate illness diagnosis

**Ethics and Privacy**
Understanding privacy laws surrounding data acquisition and usage
Research on the idea of privacy and its recent roles in society with respect to laws and regulations, human rights, and individual perception.
From an ethical standpoint, how should AI be implemented moving forward?

**Data Systems**
Understanding how stakeholders manage and analyze collected data and what they hope their money goes towards
